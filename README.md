# ICS3U1-CPT
This repository contains all the stuff for my CPT for ICS3U1

Please add any nessicary files to the repository.

UPDATES:

Added a menu! Now we don't have to restart after the game is over

Added square logic! HORAAAAAYYY!!!

Time from now on will be used to make the game look pretty;
will focus more on the asthetics since the functionality of the game is solid.







ETC:

REMEMBER:

ORGANIZATION! 

A thing for a place and a place for a thing.

Keep stuff organized and it will be easy to find said "stuff".

I'm the only one who will use this repo...

I guess I'm talking to myself..................
